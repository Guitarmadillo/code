This DLL was compiled in version 2564 of Sierra Chart on 2023-11-14.

This is a custom study that performs a feature that we originally discovered in the platform Jigsaw Daytradr. It moves the closest OCO order (either the target or stop) to the price you hover the cursor over on the chart or trading DOM. It is a method of moving attached orders very fast when manually trading. This study is to be used with OCO orders and it will not function with unattached limit orders. There is no need for this because an OCO order should always be used, for the purpose of risk management and protection of your trading account.

The instructions for how to use this study are provided in This Video by VerrilloTrading. There is one missing step in that video which is #3 in the following text.

Instructions:
1. Add the study to your chart and choose the desired ACS button to perform the function.
2. Program this ACS button to a keyboard shortcut.
3. On your trading chart or DOM, make sure that Trade > Auto Trading Enabled - Global and Auto Trading Enabled - Chart are both turned on.
